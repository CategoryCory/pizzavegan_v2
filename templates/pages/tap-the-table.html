                attention to&mdash;and consumers closer to&mdash;vegan pizza through exclusive editorial content, a
                product guide, recipes, a directory of independent pizzerias offering vegan pizza, and a kickoff
                promotion during the month of November that begins on World Vegan Day, November 1! Through
                PizzaVegan.com, vegan consumers will have an unprecedented opportunity to find vegan versions of
                Americans' favorite food: pizza.

            <h5 class="primary-text">Why Now?</h5>
            <p>Vegan pizza has never been more popular than it is now. Here's a look at the numbers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    60% of Americans have started to eat a more plant-based diet since the beginning of the pandemic,
                    according to a recent poll of 2,000 adults by OnePoll. Respondents cited health as the No. 1 reason
                    for this change, but they also cited a desire to consume less animal products and lead a more
                    sustainable lifestyle. The same poll revealed that 39% of people ages 18 to 25, and 23% of people
                    ages 26 to 41, already exclude animal products from their diets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ADM reports that 44% of U.S. consumers identify as flexitarians--those who eat a mostly vegetarian
                    diet, with occasional servings of meat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The average American eats four meat-free meals per week, and 50% of Americans are trying to
                    incorporate more plant-based meals in their daily lives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    25% of customers are looking for vegan pizza options, but only 25% of pizzerias are offering them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 2019, plant-based food sales had increased by 31% over the last two years, according to the
                    Plant Based Foods Association.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plant-based options are the fastest growing section on pizza menus today, notes trends expert
                    Daniel Levine of the Avant-Guide Institute in New York City.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="primary-text">How It Works</h5>
            <p>As a participating pizzeria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide a link to your online ordering (through the Facebook-based service Tap The Table or your
                    own ordering link), an image, and a description of your vegan pizza offering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Display point-of-sale elements, such as a window cling, box topper, table tent, door hanger and
                    social media graphics, from November 1 to December 1, 2020. These materials are provided by PMQ
                    Pizza Magazine upon registration.
