                    Vegan diets have gained incredible traction in recent years, and experts say this movement is no
                    mere fad or trend. It reflects a true shift in eating habits that will continue to grow in the
                    future. For example, according to a 2020 poll of 2,000 adults by OnePoll, 39% of people ages 18 to
                    25, and 23% of people ages 26 to 41, already exclude animal products from their diets. Other
                    studies show that even meat eaters are adding in more plant-based meals and embracing the
                    flexitarian lifestyle.

                    Whether their goals are planetary sustainability, improved health, or promoting the animal
                    population, more consumers are seeking vegan options in restaurants around the country and
                    world&mdash;including, of course, within Americans' favorite food category: pizza.
